# Hardebusch Family Genealogy

Welcome to the Hardebusch Family Genealogy repository. This project is a personal endeavor to trace and document the Hardebusch lineage using various genealogical tools and techniques. The repository contains a Gramps export of the family tree, as well as a live version available for viewing.

- `Hardebusch.gramps`: This file is the export from Gramps, an open-source genealogy software. It contains all the detailed information about the family tree.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading that provides an overview of the repository and its contents.
